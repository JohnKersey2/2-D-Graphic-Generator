## Criteria 

I was to create a command line application that accepts user input to generate a logo. The user was to be prompted for three letters, a shape, color for the text, and color for the background. After the input was submitted, the console logged "Generated logo.svg" and a 300x200 pixel image is generated.

## Known Issues

Tests aren't currently implemented.

## Future Development Notes

Improve the amount of customizable options, such as fonts.
